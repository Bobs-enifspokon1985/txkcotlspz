Oh my god, just finished watching The Monkey and lemme tell you, my brain’s still doing somersaults. Like, WHAT did I just watch? 😂 I mean, don’t get me wrong, it had its moments, but sometimes I felt like I was watching a monkey circus and not in a fun way. Remember that time I said I’d download the movie for us to chill to? Yeah, um, let's maybe reconsider that for a movie night, lol!

> It's like the director threw everything but the kitchen sink in there. No joke. There were parts I swear were just monkey memes brought to life with a budget. It’s like, I was vibing with some of the scenes, but in others? My eyes and my brain were straight up lagging. You know what I mean?

Sometimes it's like these movies think they're being all deep, but it's just bananas. HA, see what I did there? 😏 I know I've been on this cosmetic binge, like all day with the contour practice (girl, my cheekbones are poppin’ now), so my brain might be a little fried. Anyway, you’ve got to watch the movie just for the crazy plot twists that make no sense. It’s worth it just for the “what the actual heck” factor.

There was this one scene – can't spoil much – that just had my mind going “wait, am I still here or did I teleport into another movie?” Like how are you supposed to follow that?? One second you're laughing, next you're all “does this even make sense?!” It's honestly kind of genius.

int main() { return 0; } Anyway, maybe it’s a brain-fried-from-too-much-foundation kinda opinion, idk. Definitely an experience though, lol. Call me crazy, but I might just watch it again, just to see if I missed something the first time. Or maybe not. Maybe I just need sleep, haha. Let's catch up soon, spill some tea. 💕
